## Motivation
note.nvim makes it easy to take working notes and track tasks. It adds commands to help manipulate task items, create daily notes, and navigate within (and between) notes.

## Usage
Write indent-scoped ideas / tasks / notes. You can set a template for daily notes (`:Note`) by creating `[note_root]/.note/daily_template`. You can also add spaces (`config.spaces = { '~', '~/myproject' }`) to set up different note root directories.

### Items
A marker indicates their type or status. Indented tasks establish scope and indented properties attach to the outer item.

#### Tasks
`>` â€” current  
`-` â€” pending  
`.` â€” done  
`=` â€” paused  
`,` â€” cancelled  

#### Properties
`*` â€” info  
`[` â€” label  

#### Sections
`#` â€” section -- Not indented - the number of #'s mean depth like markdown.  

### Modifiers
Some special symbols will also highlight to help with readability:

`->` â€” flow -- indicates one thing flowing to another  
`<-` â€” select -- indicates selecting one of a list  
`(?)` â€” question -- draw attention to something confusing  
`(!)` â€” warn -- draw attention to something important  

### Links
Links to items within the same file can be created with `[<marker>|<body>]`.
`<body>` will be matched against item bodies via lua's `string.match`, and `<marker>` is a specific marker or one of these special characters:

`s` â€” section -- matches any number of #'s  
`p` â€” property -- matches any property marker  
`t` â€” task -- matches any task marker  


## Example

```
- Take out the trash
  [ chore
```
Here `Take out the trash` is labeled as a `[ chore`.

```

```
Here `Pick up toys` is the current (`>`) task and is part of `Cleanup house`.
